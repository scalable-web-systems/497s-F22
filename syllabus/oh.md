# Office Hours

Office hours are an opportunity for you to get answers to your questions and more generally for you to interact with the course staff. We welcome all questions you may have about the course material and assignments. Although you are welcome to ask questions about problems you are having with your code, you may find that you will get answers to code issues more quickly if you post to Piazza. It is often difficult to understand you question, your code, and find the issue during office hours with several other people. So, be strategic with your time and the teaching staff's time.

We are looking forward to talking with you in office hours!
